Overview: Telegram Forward & Auto-Posting Bot

Purpose

The Forward & Auto-Posting Bot is a lightweight Telegram bot designed to streamline message management across multiple group chats and channels. It provides two core features:

Message Forwarding: Allows group admins to forward specific messages to other chats where the bot is present, using an intuitive inline keyboard interface.
Auto-Chat Tracking: Automatically updates an internal list of chats whenever the bot is added to a new group, supergroup, or channel, enabling seamless forwarding without manual configuration.
Built with Python and the python-telegram-bot library, this bot is ideal for community managers, moderators, or anyone needing to relay information across Telegram spaces efficiently.
